https://arxiv.org/html/2502.16153v1,"Understanding Screenwriters’ Practices, Attitudes, and Future Expectations in Human-AI Co-Creation",9,research,"1. Introduction
Screenwriting involves the creation of screenplays that integrate visual and auditory elements to support storytelling in film, television, and other audiovisual formats (Dunnigan, 2019 ), with the aim of evoking emotional responses through detailed plot structures, dialogue, and scenes (Howard and Mabley, 1993 ).
Belonging to the area of creative writing, screenwriting also has an imaginative and narrative focus (Kerrigan and Batty, 2016 ; Batty, 2015 ).
As a result, it faces similar challenges to creative writing, such as a lack of inspiration and guidance (Gero et al., 2023 ).
Futhermore, its distinctive emphasis on incorporating visual and auditory considerations adds layers of complexity to the creative processes and necessitates tailored approaches to addressing these challenges (Duncan, 2020 )."
https://arxiv.org/html/2502.16153v1,"Understanding Screenwriters’ Practices, Attitudes, and Future Expectations in Human-AI Co-Creation",10,research,"1. Introduction
The rapid advancement of technology has enabled the application of AI in screenwriting (Anguiano and Beckett, 2023 ). Previous research demonstrates that AI can support screenwriters by summarizing and cross-checking content to ensure the consistency of screenplay text (Sanghrajka et al., 2017 ; Kapadia et al., 2015 ), as well as analyzing emotions through plot units (Goyal et al., 2010 ). With developments ranging from natural language processing (NLP) to deep learning (DL), AI capabilities have evolved from processing and summarizing content to generating it, offering innovative solutions to screenwriting challenges. For instance, AI can generate character roles with diverse appearances and dialogue styles (Qin et al., 2024 ), assisting users in sparking creative ideas."
https://arxiv.org/html/2502.16153v1,"Understanding Screenwriters’ Practices, Attitudes, and Future Expectations in Human-AI Co-Creation",11,research,"1. Introduction
These advancements in AI have shown their ability to enhance screenwriters’ productivity and creativity, leading to economic and industry-wide impacts (Chow, 2020 ). The role of AI in screenwriting was notably highlighted during the Hollywood writers’ strike when the Writers Guild of America and production companies reached an agreement defining AI as a supporting tool rather than a replacement for writers (Board, 2023 ). The agreement prohibits AI from receiving credit, ensures fair compensation for human writers, and allows optional AI assistance for tasks such as script drafting. This reflects the growing integration of advanced AI technologies in screenwriting and their transformative impact on the industry, motivating further exploration of AI’s role in screenwriting."
https://arxiv.org/html/2502.16153v1,"Understanding Screenwriters’ Practices, Attitudes, and Future Expectations in Human-AI Co-Creation",12,research,"1. Introduction
While prior studies highlight AI’s expanding role and its impact on screenwriting education (Brako and Mensah, 2023 ) and the broader filmmaking process (Naji, 2024 ), there remains limited understanding of how AI is applied across different stages of the screenwriting workflow. To address this gap, we propose RQ1, which seeks to explore screenwriters’ current practices, including their task allocation involving AI tools."
https://arxiv.org/html/2502.16153v1,"Understanding Screenwriters’ Practices, Attitudes, and Future Expectations in Human-AI Co-Creation",13,research,"1. Introduction
Additionally, existing research has primarily focused on topics such as attitudes (Grigis and De Angeli, 2024 ), copyright (Kavitha, 2023 ), and labor considerations (Chow, 2020 ). However, it provides limited insights into the nuanced relationship between screenwriters’ diverse attitudes toward AI and its practical effects across various stages of their workflows. To address this gap, we propose RQ2, which focuses on understanding the reasons behind screenwriters’ differing attitudes and how these attitudes influence their practices regarding AI integration and their perceptions of AI’s impact."

Finally, recent work by Grigis and Angeli examined the features, strategies, and outcomes of LLM-assisted playwriting (Grigis and De Angeli, 2024 ), and the Dramatron system, developed by Mirowski et al. (Mirowski et al., 2023 ), demonstrated the potential of integrating LLMs into screenwriting workflows. However, these studies focus solely on LLMs, neglecting advancements in AI-generated images and videos. A broader understanding of how emerging and rapidly evolving AI technologies may address the dynamic and evolving needs of screenwriters is still lacking. To address this gap, we propose RQ3, which aims to explore screenwriters’ detailed expectations for future AI tools.

Our study builds on prior research on AI integration in creative processes, AI tools for creative writing, and AI-supported screenwriting, highlighting gaps specific to screenwriting. These gaps stem from its unique characteristics, including audiovisual storytelling (Senje, 2017 ), structured principles (McKee, 1997 ), and multi-stakeholder collaboration (Taylor and Batty, 2024 ; Cake, 2021 ; Batty et al., 2018 ).

TaleStream combines AI recommendation algorithms with database-driven trope suggestions for narratives but has yet to integrate evolving generative AI technologies (Chou et al., 2023 ). Rule-based methods for story extension have also been explored (Lebowitz, 1984 ; Meehan, 1977 ; Riedl and Young, 2010 ). However, we found that these approaches primarily focus on text-based support and do not incorporate visual elements. In character creation, prior works demonstrate that AI can simulate characters’ personalities (Cavazza et al., 2001 ), infer characters’ relationships (Chaturvedi et al., 2017 ), facilitate AI-character dialogues (Qin et al., 2024 ), and map character trajectories (Chung et al., 2022 ).

Additionally, challenges in human-AI collaboration remain. Grigis and Angeli recently examined the limitations of LLM-assisted writing, particularly in handling taboos and conflicts (Grigis and De Angeli, 2024 ). Dhillon et al. emphasized the importance of personalized systems to accommodate the diverse experiences of writers (Dhillon et al., 2024 ), and Lee et al. provided broad recommendations for the development of future AI tools (Lee et al., 2024 ).

This limitation reduces the suitability of these approaches for certain types of creative writing, particularly screenwriting, which is inherently characterized by audiovisual and dynamic storytelling (Senje, 2017 ). Furthermore, existing studies often focus on isolated stages of the creative process, overlooking the complete workflow that integrates structured principles (McKee, 1997 ) and collaboration with stakeholders (Taylor and Batty, 2024 ; Cake, 2021 ; Batty et al., 2018 ), both of which are essential to screenwriting.

Tools like Final Draft (Madnick and Cahan, 2024 ) integrate AI for scene management and formatting, streamlining the screenwriting process. For emotional support, earlier studies have explored emotion analysis in narratives (Stapleton and Hughes, 2003 ). Goyal et al.’s AESOP system analyzes emotions through plot units, helping screenwriters understand emotional trajectories (Goyal et al., 2010 ).

In data visualization, studies have summarized storylines (Tapaswi et al., 2014 ) and managed character arcs (Kim et al., 2017a ), providing a foundation for data-driven AI systems. In visual representation, AI tools use NLP to create 2D and 3D visualizations of screenplay content (Marti et al., 2018 ; Kim et al., 2017a ), including character interactions (Won et al., 2014 ) and scenes (Hanser et al., 2009 ).

On average, they had approximately four years of screenwriting-related experience, which included either studies, work, or a combination of both (refer to Table 1 ). Their average self-reported proficiency level with AI in screenwriting was three out of five, suggesting a moderate level of familiarity. The majority of participants (78%) had experience using AI in screenwriting and are referred to as P (e.g., P1)"

The remaining 22% had not used AI tools in screenwriting and are referred to as N (e.g., N1). We did not use prior experience with AI as an inclusion criterion during recruitment for the following reasons. Participants without AI experience offered valuable insights into most research questions, including workflows, challenges, attitudes, and expectations toward AI, thereby enriching the findings. We retained responses from all 23 participants to achieve more comprehensive results. Each interview was conducted individually via an online meeting platform to ensure participant engagement and thorough data collection."

We collected 117 pages of interview notes and 558 pages of transcripts. Two authors conducted a qualitative analysis using an inductive approach to open coding, following the six stages of thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006 ) : 1) Familiarizing ourselves with the data: We reviewed transcripts and recordings to ensure a full understanding of the content. 2) Generating initial codes: We independently coded sections based on the interview outline, including screenwriting workflow, AI tool feedback, and interaction methods. 3) Searching for themes: We compared initial codes and explored emerging themes. To adhere to the reflective thematic analysis method, we did not establish inter-rater reliability but instead acknowledged the influence of both authors on the analysis"

4. Findings 1: Existing Practices
Seventy-eight percent of our 23 participants reported having used AI in the screenwriting process, providing feedback on AI’s application. Therefore, Sections 4.1 and 4.2 include perspectives from all 23 participants, while the Section 4.3 reflects specific feedback from the 18 participants (78%) who had used AI in screenwriting. The tools mentioned by participants fall into two categories: traditional screenwriting tools and AI tools. The AI tools they used include AI text generation tools (e.g., ChatGPT, WPS AI, Kimi, AI Dungeon), AI image generation tools (e.g., Midjourney, Runway), and AI sound generation tools (e.g., DeepMusic)."

https://arxiv.org/html/2502.16153v1,"Understanding Screenwriters’ Practices, Attitudes, and Future Expectations in Human-AI Co-Creation",60,research,"4.1. Workflow
As mentioned in Section 2.4 regarding the complexity of the screenwriting workflow, we first summarized the participants’ workflows. Through interviews with 23 screenwriters, we identified a common workflow encompassing the following key stages: goal & idea, synopsis & outline, character, story structure & plot, dialogue, and screenplay text as Fig. 2. Despite individual differences, we found consensus on the core stages involved in screenwriting, highlighting shared practices across creative approaches. This commonality supports the workflow we have summarized. Our subsequent analysis will proceed within the context of this workflow."
https://arxiv.org/html/2502.16153v1,"Understanding Screenwriters’ Practices, Attitudes, and Future Expectations in Human-AI Co-Creation",61,research,4.2. Challenges
https://arxiv.org/html/2502.16153v1,"Understanding Screenwriters’ Practices, Attitudes, and Future Expectations in Human-AI Co-Creation",62,research,"Before exploring how screenwriters use AI, we first analyzed the challenges they face in their current workflow, which can be categorized into four main aspects: lack of inspiration, insufficient coherence, inadequate content depth, and lack of emotional resonance. Among the participants, 15 out of 23 reported frequently experiencing a lack of inspiration, primarily due to a limited understanding of the real world and personal experience, which hinders the generation of innovative ideas in character development and plot creation. Additionally, 22 out of 23 participants mentioned issues with coherence in their screenplays. The importance of aligning dialogue with context and character settings was emphasized by 13 participants, and 10 participants highlighted the need for logical coherence in plot structure. Furthermore, seven out of 23 participants felt their screenplays often lacked depth, particularly in story themes and emotional dialogue"
https://arxiv.org/html/2502.16153v1,"Understanding Screenwriters’ Practices, Attitudes, and Future Expectations in Human-AI Co-Creation",63,research,". Another eight participants expressed difficulties in creating content that resonates with the audience, especially in dialogue and plot. In subsequent Sections 4.3, we found that screenwriters have already begun exploring the use of AI to address some of these challenges."

https://arxiv.org/html/2502.16153v1,"Understanding Screenwriters’ Practices, Attitudes, and Future Expectations in Human-AI Co-Creation",65,research,"To understand screenwriters’ use of AI across different workflow stages, we analyzed the usage and satisfaction across the six workflow stages mentioned above, based on responses from the 18 participants who had previously used AI in screenwriting, as shown in Table 2. In addition, to further understand the tasks currently allocated to AI by screenwriters at different workflow stages, we categorized specific tasks by distinguishing between human-provided information and AI-generated content. Human-provided information refers to the input screenwriters contribute when interacting with AI, while AI-generated content refers to the output produced by AI based on the screenwriter’s input, as outlined in Table 3. Note that the five participants who had not used AI in screenwriting (N) were not included in this section as they did not provide relevant data"

In this stage, screenwriters often encounter challenges related to a lack of inspiration (Section 4.2 ). Consequently, they sought AI assistance. According to our interview results, P1, P3, P4, P7, P11, P14, P16, and P17 stated that they used AI at this stage and felt that AI could meet their needs. The human-provided information at this stage is primarily to determine the subject matter, genre, and elements to be included in the screenplay. Screenwriters use AI to obtain inspiration, assist with information retrieval, determine the theme direction, establish world-building, generate concept images, create story outlines, and develop character biographies. The needs of screenwriters at this stage are often vague, but they hope that AI can help them explore different concepts and inspire their next steps."

P17 stated, “ I sometimes feed the client’s requirements into the AI to see what feedback it gives. It can help me set the tone by triggering certain keywords, which I then rearrange to get closer to what I want. ” However, P4 and P5 expressed dissatisfaction with AI’s effectiveness at this stage. P4 noted, “ At the beginning, I tried using keywords to generate an outline, and I also tried using an outline to generate a script, but both attempts failed. It felt like AI couldn’t understand the relationship between the characters. The content produced was strange and disconnected. ” These responses indicate that AI, due to its lack of understanding of human emotions and complex human relationships, does not have sufficient capability to generate synopses and outlines"

As P4 noted: “ For example, when I suddenly needed a name, I used AI to generate a few names for me, and I thought they were quite interesting and playful. ” P15 stated: “ I had a spaceship captain character. I knew roughly his age and that he was a villain. The AI quickly gave me a detailed profile, including his height, weight, tragic childhood, and his current evil goals. I could then make modifications based on this. It was much faster than trying to come up with everything from scratch, especially since gathering material for this kind of character is so complex. ” Participants indicated that, with current inputs, AI meets basic expectations for character-related tasks like generating names and biographies"

In this stage, screenwriters often meet challenges in maintaining the coherence of story pieces and having an in-depth structure (Section 4.2 ). As a result, they would like to seek AI’s assistance. Compared to other stages, more screenwriters preferred to work with AI in this stage.
According to our interview results, 12 participants reported using AI, but only two of them stated that AI could produce satisfactory results ( P8 and P15 ).
This stage had the most AI users and involved various human-provided informations, including providing genre, basic plots, storyboards, character settings, story outlines, scene settings, and reference images."

P13 noted that while AI-generated structures were technically sound, the content was rigid. P16 felt that while AI-generated images helped expand plot details, AI-generated text was often dull and logically incoherent. P2, P6, and P17 criticized AI’s limited understanding of film and television resources, with P17 stating: “ The content generated by the AI is unusable for me. ” This is a process that participants frequently feel inefficient and time-consuming"

However, P1, P4, P8, P9, P11, and P15 attempted to use AI for dialogue generation, but none were fully satisfied with its assistance. Their inputs include genre, character design, basic dialogue, and detailed dialogue scenarios. The primary concern among participants was that AI struggled with handling more complex scenarios, particularly in maintaining the nuanced interactions required for effective dialogue writing. For example, P8 attempted to use ChatGPT to write a dialogue between two animals for a children’s story but found that AI couldn’t handle highly complex scenarios. P11 mentioned, “ AI generated a short story with a Wong Kar-Wai style, including dialogue and a literary feel, but it was only useful for brief inspiration. It wasn’t suitable for actual screenwriting work"

However, only P16 felt that AI could optimize screenplay content, with P16 noting that AI was effective in transforming plain sentences into narration in a specific style. The remaining participants ( P4, P7, P10, P12, P13, P14, P15, and P18 ) were generally dissatisfied with AI’s performance. P10 described AI-generated scripts as “completely useless and misleading.” P12 pointed out that AI only completed “ 10% to 20% of the work, with the rest needing to be done manually. ” P18 also criticized AI’s output as “ too crude and not specific enough. ” Based on the perspectives of our participants, the majority expressed that due to AI’s current limitations in contextual understanding and logical coherence (Section 5.1"

In our study, screenwriters primarily used AI tools in four key stages: story structure & plot development, screenplay text, goal & idea generation, and dialogue, particularly for repetitive tasks like plot revisions (refer to Table 2 and Table 3 ). However, they reported less AI use in the synopsis & outline stages, preferring to rely on personal efforts. Regarding satisfaction, participants acknowledged AI’s ability to inspire ideas and meet basic needs in the goal & idea generation and character development stages. However, fewer participants were satisfied with AI’s performance in the story structure & plot development, screenplay text, and dialogue stages, due to its limitations (see Section 5.1.2 ). Future research should consider enhancing AI capabilities in these areas."

Lack of Authentic Experiences Hindering AI Models’ Emotion Perception. AI lacks the ability to replicate authentic experiences, which are deeply tied to personal emotions and life events, as noted by 12 participants. P2 explained, “ Creativity stems from my emotions—what makes me deeply pained or joyful. ” P4, P7, and P8 avoided AI for tasks demanding deep emotional resonance, such as pivotal scenes. P7 observed, “ AI captures simple emotions, like a father’s love depicted as both smiling happily. But love is far more complex than that. ” Participants highlighted that human creativity integrates nuanced, dynamic emotional flows across dialogue, behavior, and context, whereas AI relies on simplistic, discrete representations, limiting its application in screenwriting."

Structured Text Generation Capability. Participants argued that AI provides enhanced efficiency for structural tasks. P2, P8, P12, P15, and P17 expressed positive views on structured text generation, highlighting its utility for predefined tasks such as screenplay outlines or foundational structures. P12 described that AI can assist us more with format-related tasks. P15 emphasized its value for beginners, as it reduces cognitive load and allows for a greater focus on creative aspects.
On the other hand, participants also expressed that AI is unsuitable for complex narrative tasks. P1, P12, P13, P16, and P18, who were critical of structured text generation, pointed out that it is overly structure-driven, resulting in repetitive frameworks and limited meaningful plot progression. They deemed it unsuitable for dialogue writing or intricate narrative development within the complete screenplay text."

Pastiche Text and Image Generation Capability. Participants mentioned that AI has been adopted in speculative and non-realistic genres. P9, P11, P12, P14, and P17 valued AI’s imaginative potential for idea generation in science fiction and surrealism. P14 remarked, “ AI is good at piecing together different elements and creating connections and narrative forms that differ from human thinking,” enabling the exploration of unconventional connections and narrative styles well-suited to these genres. On the contrary, participants highlighted their rejection of AI usage in realistic genres. P4, P7, P8, P9, P12, P14, P16, and P17 avoided AI-generated pastiche content in logically coherent genres like documentaries. P4 and P16 criticized AI’s poor contextual understanding, which caused illogical plot twists and unrelated character behaviors, disrupting the storyline."

However, due to the limitations of their knowledge base, participants sought a reliable source of inspiration to deepen their understanding of character identities and traits. To address these needs, we categorized the screenwriters’ expectations of AI as an “actor” into two key areas: AI functions and screenwriter engagement. Additionally, as participants perceived the “actor” as being related to and aligned with the screenplay’s characters, this role was expected to provide more detailed character information, supporting the exploration of the screenplay’s goals, along with the characters’ motivations and emotions. Participants anticipated that the “actor” role would be primarily applied during the goal & idea, character, and dialogue stages (as shown in Table 5 )."

They expect to define characters through parameters such as writing style, detailed story outline, character information, backstories, reactions in specific situations, and current scenarios. Following this setup, 18 participants expressed a strong desire to enhance their portrayal of characters by engaging in dialogue with the AI “actor.” This feature allows screenwriters to maintain control and guide the AI to obtain the necessary information. Ideal interactions with the AI “actor” suggested by participants fall into three categories (Using Titanic as an example, where Jack and Rose are the main characters and AI is playing the role of Jack, there are three categories of screenwriter engagement as illustrated in Fig. 3"
https://arxiv.org/html/2502.16153v1,"Understanding Screenwriters’ Practices, Attitudes, and Future Expectations in Human-AI Co-Creation",122,research,". 3.): (1) the screenwriter interacts with AI Jack as a character within the screenplay’s story world (e.g., screenwriter as Rose), (2) the screenwriter engages with AI Jack as a character outside the screenplay’s story world (e.g., screenwriter as a bystander), and (3) the screenwriter observes interactions between AI Rose and AI Jack (e.g., screenwriter as an observer). Meanwhile, some participants ( P2, P6, P9, P13, P15, N1, N4, and N5 ) hoped to seamlessly switch between these methods to offer more choice and immersive experience, as characters reveal different facets to different people.

Description for Figure 3:
This chart illustrates three different modes of screenwriter engagement with AI during the creative process: Internal Character, External Character, and Observer. Using the characters Jack and Rose from Titanic as examples, the chart explains how screenwriters interact with AI in the story world. Here are the detailed descriptions for each mode:
1. Screenwriter as an Internal Character
- In the first box on the left, the screenwriter is represented as an internal character within the story world, such as playing the role of Rose.
- In this setup, the screenwriter interacts with the AI, which plays another character, like Jack.
- Through communication (indicated by two-way arrows), the screenwriter as Rose engages in dialogue and interaction with the AI as Jack.
- This means the screenwriter directly participates in the story world, experiencing and advancing the narrative as an internal character."
https://arxiv.org/html/2502.16153v1,"Understanding Screenwriters’ Practices, Attitudes, and Future Expectations in Human-AI Co-Creation",124,research,"2. Screenwriter as an External Character
- The middle box shows the screenwriter as an external character, such as a bystander who does not directly participate in the core plot.
- The AI still plays the main role of Jack, while the screenwriter, as an external character, communicates and interacts with the AI’s character.
- In this mode, there is still interaction between the screenwriter and the AI character, but the screenwriter is not a central character, participating in the story from a secondary perspective.
3. Screenwriter as an Observer
- In the third box on the right, the screenwriter is positioned as an observer, acting in their role as a screenwriter rather than a character.
- In this case, the screenwriter does not directly participate in the story but instead watches the interaction between AI characters. The chart shows the AI playing both Rose and Jack, while the screenwriter observes their dialogue."

Screenwriter as an Internal Character. The first category involves interacting with the AI “actor” as specific characters within the screenplay’s story world ( P2, P4, P5, P7, P9, P10, P11, P15, P16, N1, N2, and N4 ). P10 suggested that refining character portrayals through multiple character perspectives within the story world would lead to more precise and nuanced character development. They argued that this form of interaction could directly influence the final screenplay, showing specific behaviors. As P16 noted: “ I feel that directly playing a character benefits my creativity. By embodying a character, I can better understand how another character would react in a given situation… it helps to think about what each character would do or say in the moment.

The second category involves interacting with the AI “actor” as characters outside the screenplay’s story world, such as the screenwriter, a bystander, or a family member not depicted in the screenplay ( P2, P6, P10, P11, P12, P13, P15, N1, N3, and N4 ). Since these characters are not directly tied to the screenplay, the interactions do not immediately affect the final text. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the character through the perspectives of additional personas imagined by the screenwriters, creating more realistic and well-rounded characters enriched by detailed backgrounds and biographies. P2 noted, “ It’s necessary to use a ’god’s eye view’ to see the various forms a character takes. It’s very effective! ” P11 compared talking to AI characters to interviewing real people, saying, “ I might, as the screenwriter, directly ask the character about the plot, reading them dialogue from my script and seeing how they respond. ”"

Participants identified four key roles for AI in screenwriting: “actor,” “audience,” “expert,” and “executor.” As an “actor,” AI simulates characters, particularly in the goal & idea, character, and dialogue stages. In the “audience” role, AI provides feedback during the goal & idea, character, story structure & plot, and screenplay text stages. As an “expert,” AI supports all stages by offering guidance. In the “executor” role, AI transforms ideas into outcomes, primarily applied in the character, story structure & plot, and screenplay text stages. These roles underscore AI’s ability to complement human creativity rather than replace it."

We envision that there are two crucial steps, data collection and model training, in the lifecycle of model development can be improved based on findings from our research.

7.1.1. Data Collection
Based on our findings mentioned in Section 7, building multimodal, fine-grained datasets across diverse scenarios is essential for addressing screenwriters’ needs. We propose three key dimensions for acquiring data: social media feedback, high-quality works, and crowdsourced observations."
https://arxiv.org/html/2502.16153v1,"Understanding Screenwriters’ Practices, Attitudes, and Future Expectations in Human-AI Co-Creation",152,research,"7.1.1. Data Collection
Social Media Feedback. Social computing methods analyze audience feedback derived from social media activity, fan discussions, and sentiment trends. These analyses provide valuable insights into emotional responses and narrative expectations across various demographics. By categorizing feedback based on genre preferences, emotional resonance, and storytelling trends, AI systems can better align their outputs with specific screenplay genres. For “actor” roles, social data offers insights into audience perceptions of character traits, relationships, and dynamics, thereby enhancing the AI’s ability to generate resonant and relatable characters."

Section 5.1.1 and Section 6.1.1 highlight the need to deepen AI’s understanding of contextual factors and characters’ internal emotions, while Section 6.4.2 emphasizes narrative-driven emotional integration, focusing on plot context and character relationships. Accordingly, we provide suggestions for training models that are centered on context and characters. Meanwhile, to align with screenwriters’ expectations for conflict-driven narratives (Grigis and De Angeli, 2024 ), datasets can be structured using the theory of conflict (Lawson, 1936 ; Eisenstein, 2014 ), categorized into Human vs. Nature, Human vs. Society, Human vs. Human, and Human vs. Self."
https://arxiv.org/html/2502.16153v1,"Understanding Screenwriters’ Practices, Attitudes, and Future Expectations in Human-AI Co-Creation",156,research,"7.1.2. Model Training
Contextual Emotion Modeling. Screenwriters require AI systems capable of dynamically adapting to evolving narrative contexts. Future systems should represent emotions as continuous dynamic trajectories and incorporate diverse conflict types such as Human vs. Nature and Human vs. Society. To ensure that AI models can generate contextually appropriate responses, it is possible to leverage reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) techniques to train attention-based language models that can effectively capture the contextual information following humans’ approaches (Niu et al., 2021 ). Additionally, multidimensional emotion modeling (Gafà et al., 2023 ) has the potential to enable continuous dynamic simulations, facilitating coherent emotional shifts that enhance narrative depth and maintain alignment with story progression."

To achieve the target, an additional GNN model might be trained on subtle emotional cues enhances modeling for conflicts like Human vs. Human and Human vs. Self.
It can serve as a powerful method to model the character relationships (Wu et al., 2020 ), with nodes as characters and edges capturing emotional or conflict-driven interactions. Incorporating the prediction results of this GNN model has the potential to better capture the dynamic and nuanced changes in characters’ emotions."

Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration. Advancing AI’s emotional intelligence requires collaboration among cognitive scientists, psychologists, screenwriters, and AI developers (Assunção et al., 2022 ; Zhao et al., 2022 ). A Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach, such as RLHF or model fine-tuning with human-labeled datasets, could bridge technical and creative expertise by integrating expert feedback into AI development (Wu et al., 2023 ). This approach has the potential for accurate modeling of emotional nuances and adaptability to diverse narrative contexts. The iterative process enhances AI’s reliability and ensures creative alignment with screenwriters’ evolving needs.

Based on the model training approach focused on context and characters as discussed in Section 7.1.2, and reflecting the scene and character emphasis in screenwriting, we propose three interaction methods.

7.2.1. For Emotional Intelligence Enhancement
Contextual Interactions. The interface should incorporate contextual factors, allowing screenwriters to shape emotional outputs based on evolving environments and stories. Features like real-time feedback, visualizations (e.g., heatmaps or evolving arcs), and contextual manipulation tools can enable adjustments to variables like settings or plot points to refine emotional trajectories. Tools such as “contextual snapshots” can help maintain narrative coherence across scene transitions (Mindek et al., 2013 )."

Character-Driven Interactions. The interface should support dynamic emotional simulations, enabling the refinement of characters’ emotional responses and relationships. Tools such as timelines or radial graphs can visualize emotional evolution, while sliders allow for fine-tuning of intensity and pace. Relationship maps can simulate changes, such as conflict or reconciliation, ensuring emotional depth and alignment with character arcs (Weiland, 2023 )."

Context-Character Interwoven Interactions. To integrate context and character dynamics, the interface should align characters’ emotions with contextual elements. Real-time scenario testing can explore interactions, such as weather changes affecting emotional states. Moreover, incorporating collaborative modes could encourage contributions from screenwriters and stakeholders, providing visualizations to align with unified storytelling objectives. Additionally, as discussed in Section 7.2.3, multimodal outputs could further enhance creativity and improve communication efficiency.

7.2.2. For Flexibility and Role Adaptation
Interactive solutions like modular input and multi-agent systems provide structured and dynamic methods for seamlessly adapting “actor” and “audience” roles in collaborative screenwriting."

Modular Input. For “actor” roles, modular components create detailed character maps, detailing traits, backstories, relationships, and emotional states. These interfaces allow screenwriters to dynamically refine profiles, supporting seamless and flexible role transitions (Ye et al., 2023 ). For “audience” roles, modular inputs define segments by demographics, preferences, or emotional metrics, integrating with “actor” modules to simulate audience responses to character roles, plot points, or themes."
https://arxiv.org/html/2502.16153v1,"Understanding Screenwriters’ Practices, Attitudes, and Future Expectations in Human-AI Co-Creation",163,research,"7.2.2. For Flexibility and Role Adaptation
Multi-Agent Systems. For “actor” roles, characters function as independent agents interacting dynamically in a shared story world (Park et al., 2023 ). Screenwriters can modify interactions and preview narrative changes to inspire creativity. For “audience” roles, agents simulate diverse demographics, providing feedback on engagement and exploring how narrative elements spark discussions or attention, helping screenwriters craft stories that resonate with varied audiences or encourage thematic exploration.

Building on this, our study suggests that future guidelines for screenwriting should specifically consider agency in the context of human-AI collaboration. In Section 4.3, AI integration in task allocation highlights the need for human input at each stage of the workflow. In Section 6.1.2 and Section 6.4, where AI acts as an “actor” and functions as an “executor,” respectively, screenwriters emphasized the importance of maintaining control over the creative process and its potential impacts. They aim to ensure that AI serves as an extension of the screenwriter’s creative intent rather than acting as an autonomous creator"

However, as AI takes on more complex tasks, such as dialogue, structure and plot development, and even generating complete screenplays, it could challenge a screenwriter’s control over the narrative. We suggest that future AI screenwriting tool developers consider how AI tools can grant more control to screenwriters over the output, such as by providing interactive feedback loops and improving transparency in AI decision-making. Stakeholders should also think about how to maintain or regain agency by enabling screenwriters to become more adept at directing AI outputs (as discussed in Section 8.3 )."

The traditional view of screenwriters as sole creators is shifting toward a collaborative human-AI model. As noted in Section 6.1.2, screenwriters are gradually becoming curators or observers of AI-generated content in their expectations, raising concerns about originality, ownership, and creative contributions (Section 5.2.2 ). To address these concerns, we propose strategies to maintain authorial identity and frame this shift as an opportunity for innovation."

AI tools can enhance creative identity by aligning outputs with individual styles. For instance, tools like Stable Diffusion enable artists to embed their style into AI training ( AI, 2024 ). Similarly, screenwriters could guide AI outputs by uploading screenplays or outlines to refine tone, pacing, and structure while preserving stylistic specifics. Additionally, prior research highlights AI’s ability to merge trends with creators’ styles in short videos ( Kim and Kim, 2024 ), suggesting its potential to synthesize real-world events or news with screenwriters’ preferences, balancing external influences and unique styles in screenwriting."

Transparency is essential for preserving authorial identity ( Hoque et al., 2024 ). We propose tracking AI’s role at different stages, such as dialogue generation or plot development, by documenting the proportion of AI versus human contributions. This systematic breakdown allows screenwriters to reflect on their processes, recognize AI’s role, and identify areas for improvement. This approach could also safeguard creative ownership, support ethical guidelines, and inform standards for attribution and intellectual property, aiding in copyright decisions based on human and AI contributions."

Screenwriters view AI as both a competitor (Section 5.2.3 ) and a collaborator (Section 5.2.1 ), emphasizing the need for balanced training. Collaboration among AI developers, educators, and screenwriters is essential for designing effective strategies for these training programs. Inspired by Kicklighter et al.’s generative AI strategies for animation education (Kicklighter et al., 2024 ), we propose a customized training workshop program for screenwriters."

Workshops should begin by introducing AI’s strengths, limitations, and applications, guiding screenwriters in setting realistic expectations. This is especially crucial for those unfamiliar with using AI in screenwriting. Screenwriters should recognize the value AI brings, such as generating diverse ideas during brainstorming. Ethical considerations should be embedded within the training to develop technical skills, build confidence, and enhance human-AI collaboration, ultimately improving both efficiency and creativity."

Workshops offer a practical setting for screenwriters to share experiences, explore peer strategies for AI integration, and experiment with AI across different stages of the screenwriting process. Building on Kim et al.’s approach for short video producers (Mirowski et al., 2023 ), these workshops can facilitate brainstorming sessions, enabling screenwriters to leverage AI’s strengths in strategically allocating tasks between AI and humans. This approach could foster technical proficiency, build confidence, and enhance collaboration efficiency."

To balance AI’s roles as both a competitor and collaborator, training should emphasize unique human strengths, such as emotional depth and personal experience, which remain beyond the capabilities of current AI (Sections 5.1.2 and 5.2.2 ). Workshops should actively encourage reflection on these unique human attributes, promoting the exploration of innovative strategies to maintain creative control while effectively utilizing AI tools."

https://arxiv.org/html/2502.16153v1,"Understanding Screenwriters’ Practices, Attitudes, and Future Expectations in Human-AI Co-Creation",178,research,"Although our study provides valuable insights into the integration of AI in screenwriting, it is not without limitations. One primary limitation is that all participants were from China, which may introduce cultural and regional biases in the results. Additionally, the participants’ professional backgrounds and years of screenwriting experience were not directly correlated, as all information was self-reported by the participants. Furthermore, proficiency levels in AI usage among participants varied, potentially leading to differing perspectives. However, we did not specifically compare the viewpoints of participants with different AI proficiency levels, which could be a direction for future research. As AI capabilities continue to expand, there is value in exploring how advancements in AI technology might influence screenwriters’ job satisfaction, professional identity, and authorship recognition in the context of human-AI co-creation"

Additionally, the development of more intuitive AI interfaces and the commercialization or open-sourcing of advanced AI tools could make these technologies more accessible to a broader range of screenwriters. By addressing these limitations and expanding the scope of research, the field can move closer to realizing the potential of AI in screenwriting, ultimately providing screenwriters with more innovative and effective tools."

https://arxiv.org/html/2502.16153v1,"Understanding Screenwriters’ Practices, Attitudes, and Future Expectations in Human-AI Co-Creation",181,research,"In this study, we conducted a qualitative analysis of interviews with 23 screenwriters to explore their feedback on current practices, attitudes, and future roles of AI in screenwriting. The majority (78%) have integrated AI into traditional workflows, particularly in the stages of story structure & plot, screenplay text, goal & idea generation, and dialogue. Based on their responses, we gained deeper insights into screenwriters’ attitudes toward AI integration, which influence various workflow stages and the broader industry. We also identified four AI roles for future expectations: actor, audience, expert, and executor. Based on these findings, we recommend that future research focus on enhancing emotional intelligence, improving role flexibility, and advancing multithreaded and multimodal generation. Furthermore, promoting human-AI co-creation should prioritize preserving creative agency and identity while facilitating collaborative training"

Online generators
For absolute beginners, I recommend using a free online generator. You can start generating without the hassle of setting things up.

Online generators
Generate a few images and see if AI image is your thing."
https://stable-diffusion-art.com/beginners-guide/,How to use Stable Diffusion - Stable Diffusion Art,4,faq,"Online generators
Generate a few images and see if AI image is your thing.

Run on your PC
The best PC option is running Windows with an Nvidia GPU card. Most AI models are optimized for Nvidia GPUs. AMD GPUs are starting to get traction, but expect to jump through hoops to use them. The more VRAM your GPU has, the less trouble you will need to

Run on your PC
You need an Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) to run on a Mac.

Advanced GUI
The downside of free online generators is that the functionalities are pretty limited.

Advanced GUI
Use an advanced GUI (Graphical User Interface) if you’ve outgrown them. A whole array of tools are at your disposal. To name a few:

Advanced GUI
Regenerate a small part of an image with Inpainting.

Advanced GUI
Generate images based on an input image ( Image-to-image )

https://stable-diffusion-art.com/beginners-guide/,How to use Stable Diffusion - Stable Diffusion Art,6,faq,"2. Generate an image from an image
Below is an example of transforming my drawing of an apple into a photo-realistic one. ( Tutorial )

3. Photo Editing
You can use inpainting to regenerate part of an AI or real image. This is the same as Photoshop’s new generative fill function, but free.

4. Make videos
There are two main ways to make videos with Stable Diffusion: (1) from a text prompt and (2) from another video.

4. Make videos
Deforum is a popular way to make a video from a text prompt. You have probably seen one of them on social media. It looks like this.

4. Make videos
The second way is to stylize a video using Stable Diffusion. See the video-to-video tutorial.

4. Make videos
This is a more advanced topic. It is best to master text-to-image and image-to-image before diving into it."
https://stable-diffusion-art.com/beginners-guide/,How to use Stable Diffusion - Stable Diffusion Art,7,faq,"How to build a good prompt?
There’s a lot to learn to craft a good prompt. But the basic is to describe your subject in as much detail as possible. Make sure to include powerful keywords to define the style.

How to build a good prompt?
Using a prompt generator is a great way to learn a step-by-step process and important keywords. It is essential for beginners to learn a set of powerful keywords and their expected effects. This is like learning vocabulary for a new language. You can also find a short list of keywords and notes here.

How to build a good prompt?
A shortcut to generating high-quality images is to reuse existing prompts. Head to the prompt collection, pick an image you like, and steal the prompt! The downside is that you may not understand why it generates high-quality images. Read the notes and change the prompt to see the effect."
https://stable-diffusion-art.com/beginners-guide/,How to use Stable Diffusion - Stable Diffusion Art,8,faq,"How to build a good prompt?
Alternatively, use image collection sites like PlaygroundAI. Pick an image you like and remix the prompt. But it could be like finding a needle in a haystack for a high-quality prompt.

How to build a good prompt?
Treat the prompt as a starting point. Modify to suit your needs.

Rules of thumb for building good prompts
Two rules: (1) Be detailed and specific, and (2) use powerful keywords.

Be detailed and specific
Although AI advances in leaps and bounds, Stable Diffusion still cannot read your mind. You need to describe your image in as much detail as possible.

Be detailed and specific
Let’s say you want to generate a picture of a woman in a street scene. A simplistic prompt

Be detailed and specific
Well, you may not want the generate a grandma, but this technically matches your prompt. You cannot blame Stable Diffusion…

Be detailed and specific
So instead, you should write more."
https://stable-diffusion-art.com/beginners-guide/,How to use Stable Diffusion - Stable Diffusion Art,9,faq,"Be detailed and specific
So instead, you should write more.

Be detailed and specific
a young lady, brown eyes, highlights in hair, smile, wearing stylish business casual attire, sitting outside, quiet city street, rim lighting

Be detailed and specific
See the drastic difference. So work on your prompt-building skills!

Use powerful keywords
Some keywords are more powerful than others. Examples are

Use powerful keywords
Celebrity names (e.g. Emma Watson)

Use powerful keywords
Art medium (e.g. illustration, painting, photograph)

Use powerful keywords
Using them carefully can steer the image in the direction you want.

Use powerful keywords
You can learn more about prompt building and example keywords in the basics of building prompts.

Use powerful keywords
Want to cheat? Like doing homework, you can use ChatGPT to generate prompts!"
https://stable-diffusion-art.com/beginners-guide/,How to use Stable Diffusion - Stable Diffusion Art,10,faq,"Use powerful keywords
Want to cheat? Like doing homework, you can use ChatGPT to generate prompts!

What are those parameters, and should I change them?
Most online generators allow you to change a limited set of parameters. Below are some important ones:

What are those parameters, and should I change them?
Image size : The size of the output image. The standard size is 512×512 pixels. Changing it to portrait or landscape size can have a big impact on the image. For example, use portrait size to generate a full-body image.

What are those parameters, and should I change them?
Sampling step s : Use at least 20 steps. Increase if you see a blurry image.

What are those parameters, and should I change them?
CFG scale : Typical value is 7. Increase if you want the image to follow the prompt more.

What are those parameters, and should I change them?
Seed value : -1 generates a random image. Specify a value if you want the same image."
https://stable-diffusion-art.com/beginners-guide/,How to use Stable Diffusion - Stable Diffusion Art,11,faq,"What are those parameters, and should I change them?
See recommendations for other settings.

How many images should I generate?
You should always generate multiple images when testing a prompt.

How many images should I generate?
I generate 2-4 images at a time when making big changes to the prompt so that I can speed up the search. I would generate 4 at a time when making small changes to increase the chance of seeing something usable.

How many images should I generate?
Some prompt only works half of the time or less. So don’t write off a prompt based on one image.

Common ways to fix defects in images
When you see stunning AI images shared on social media, there’s a good chance they have undergone a series of post-processing steps. We will go over some of them in this section.

Face Restoration
It’s well-known in the AI artist community that Stable Diffusion is not good at generating faces. Very often, the faces generated have artifacts."
https://stable-diffusion-art.com/beginners-guide/,How to use Stable Diffusion - Stable Diffusion Art,12,faq,"Face Restoration
We often use image AI models that are trained for restoring faces, for example, CodeFormer, which AUTOMATIC1111 GUI has built-in support. See how to turn it on.

Face Restoration
Do you know there’s an update to v1.4 and v1.5 models to fix eyes? Check out how to install a VAE.

Fixing small artifacts with inpainting
It is difficult to get the image you want on the first try. A better approach is to generate an image with good composition. Then repair the defects with inpainting.

Fixing small artifacts with inpainting
Below is an example of an image before and after inpainting. Using the original prompt for inpainting works 90% of the time.

Fixing small artifacts with inpainting
There are other techniques to fix things. Read more about fixing common issues.

What are custom models?
The official models released by Stability AI and their partners are called base models. Some examples of base models are Stable Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.1."
https://stable-diffusion-art.com/beginners-guide/,How to use Stable Diffusion - Stable Diffusion Art,13,faq,"What are custom models?
Custom models are trained from the base models. Currently, most of the models are trained from v1.4 or v1.5. They are trained with additional data for generating images of particular styles or objects.

What are custom models?
Only the sky is the limit when it comes to custom models. It can be anime style, Disney style, or the style of another AI. You name it.

What are custom models?
Below is a comparison of 5 different models.

What are custom models?
It is also easy to merge two models to create a style in between.

Which model should I use?
Stick with the base models if you are starting out. There are pretty to learn and play with to keep you busy for months.

Which model should I use?
The three main versions of Stable Diffusion are v1, v2, and Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)."
https://stable-diffusion-art.com/beginners-guide/,How to use Stable Diffusion - Stable Diffusion Art,14,faq,"Which model should I use?
You may think you should start with the newer v2 models. People are still trying to figure out how to use the v2 models. Images from v2 are not necessarily better than v1’s.

Which model should I use?
There were series of SDXL models released: SDXL beta, SDXL 0.9, and the latest SDXL 1.0.

Which model should I use?
I recommend using the v1.5 and SDXL 1.0 models if you are new to Stable Diffusion.

How to train a new model?
An advantage of using Stable Diffusion is that you have total control of the model. You can create your own model with a unique style if you want. Two main ways to train models: (1) Dreambooth and (2) embedding.

How to train a new model?
Dreambooth is considered more powerful because it fine-tunes the weight of the whole model. Embeddings leave the model untouched but find keywords to describe the new subject or style.

How to train a new model?
You can experiment with the Colab notebook in the dreambooth article."
https://stable-diffusion-art.com/beginners-guide/,How to use Stable Diffusion - Stable Diffusion Art,15,faq,"How to train a new model?
You can experiment with the Colab notebook in the dreambooth article.

Negative prompts
You put what you want to see in the prompt. You put what you don’t want to see in the negative prompt. Not all Stable Diffusion services support negative prompts. But it is valuable for v1 models and a must for v2 models. It doesn’t hurt for a beginner to use a universal negative prompt. Read more about negative prompts:

How to make large prints with Stable Diffusion?
Stable Diffusion’s native resolution is 512×512 pixels for v1 models. You should NOT generate images with width and height that deviates too much from 512 pixels. Use the following size settings to generate the initial image.

How to make large prints with Stable Diffusion?
Landscape image: Set the height to 512 pixels. Set the width to higher, e.g. 768 pixels (2:3 aspect ratio)"
https://stable-diffusion-art.com/beginners-guide/,How to use Stable Diffusion - Stable Diffusion Art,16,faq,"How to make large prints with Stable Diffusion?
Portrait image: Set the width to 512 pixels. Set the height to higher, e.g. 768 pixels (3:2 aspect ratio)

How to make large prints with Stable Diffusion?
If you set the initial width and height too high, you will see duplicate subjects.

How to make large prints with Stable Diffusion?
The next step is to upscale the image. The free AUTOMATIC1111 GUI comes with some popular AI upscalers.

How to control image composition?
Stable Diffusion technology is rapidly improving. There are a few ways."
https://stable-diffusion-art.com/beginners-guide/,How to use Stable Diffusion - Stable Diffusion Art,17,faq,"Image-to-image
You can ask Stable Diffusion to roughly follow an input image when generating a new one. It’s called image-to-image. Below is an example of using an input image of an eagle to generate a dragon. The composition of the output image follows the input.

ControlNet
ControlNet similarly uses an input image to direct the output. But it can extract specific information, for example, human poses. Below is an example of using ControlNet to copy a human pose from the input image.

ControlNet
In addition to human poses, ControlNet can extract other information, such as outlines.

Regional prompting
You can specify prompts for certain parts of images using an extension called Regional Prompter. This technique is very helpful for drawing objects only in certain parts of the image.

Regional prompting
Below is an example of placing a wolf at the bottom left corner and skulls at the bottom right corner.

Regional prompting
Read the Regional Prompter tutorial to learn more to use it."

Read the Regional Prompter tutorial to learn more to use it.

Depth-to-image
Depth-to-image is another way to control composition through an input image. It can detect the foreground and the background of the input image. The output image will follow the same foreground and background. Below is an example.

Realistic people
You can use Stable Diffusion to generate photo-style realistic people. Let’s see some samples.

Realistic people
It comes down to using the right prompt and special model trained to produce photo-style realistic humans. Learn more in the tutorial for generating realistic people.

It’s measly I know, but has been generating fine forever as long as I’m not inpainting or using ControlNet. Today, however, it’s throwing OOM errors after only one generation!

Chris says: June 8, 2023 at 11:01 am When I use the Google Collab (paid Pro) and I want directly upscale the image within the text to image generation with the high res fix, it starts generating the picture, and then it tries to upscale. Within this process, it completely messes up the generated image within the first second of upscaling, moving the face around (i.e. parts of the face are then located on the neck, or the mouth is messed up…). I use the normal ESGRAN upscaler, the settings in the high res fix are denoising strength of 0.2 to 0.3. Tried steps set to zero, or 50. Does not make a difference. On other solutions like EasyDiffusion (runs locally on the PC), it works flawlessly. Anyone knows how to fix this? Reply"
